  <h1>Hello, welcome to my kinda daily blog!</h1>

  <p>How did you get here? That doesn't matter to me. Welcome to a day in the life of another person!</p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h2>About my kinda daily blog!</h2>

  <p>Welcome to my kinda daily blog (the reason why I said kinda daily is because I don't add stuff every day, so yea)! I talk about all sorts of stuff here.</p>

  <br>

  <!-- This part isn't really important -->

  <h3>Why did I make this blog?</h3>

  <p>I made this blog because I tried to make a diary, but it didn't work. However, I like tech, so I made this.</p>

  <h4>About Me</h4>

      I have nothing to talk about so am taking about the tiktok ban,

      I don't use tiktok but people depend on it to live so I think it should not be banned.
