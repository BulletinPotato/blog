  <h1> Hello, welcome to my kinda daily blog! </h1>

  <p> How did you get here? That doesn't matter to me. Welcome to a day in the life of another person! </p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <h2> About my kinda daily blog! </h2>

  <p> Welcome to my kinda daily blog (the reason why I said kinda daily is because I don't add stuff every day, so yea)! I talk about all sorts of stuff here. </p>

  <br>

  <!-- This part isn't really important -->

  <h3> Why did I make this blog? </h3>

  <p> I made this blog because I tried to make a diary, but it didn't work. However, I like tech, so I made this. </p>

  <h4> About Me </h4>

  <ul>
    <!-- About me: what I like (A tech nerd!), what I am (A school student), and my Gmail (appattack0+blog@gmail.com) -->
